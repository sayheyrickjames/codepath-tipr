# codepath-tipr
A tip calculator I made for Codepath's pre-work.

This is a tip calculator I made for my Codepath iOS (Swift) for Designers application.

Time spent: 12 hours including design (artwork, type and layout sourcing and creation) and development as a beginner. The video walkthrough was the first time I've ever used XCode or attempted to build an iOS app. Exciting stuff! I'm looking forward to learning a lot more!

Completed user stories:

 Required: User can enter in a bill total and choose a tip amount based on three fixed percentages (18%, 20% 22%).
 Optional: Add custom type, an app icon and a launch image background.

Notes:

- I'd like to add more animation
- I'd like to add multiple views
